# 🚨 CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTIONS 🚨

## Troubleshooting & Status Files
From now on, ALL troubleshooting logs, status updates, debug findings, and temporary implementation summaries MUST be saved in the `Troubleshooting_Agent/` directory.

### Rules:
1. **DO NOT** create new markdown files in the root directory unless they are core project documentation (e.g., `README.md`) or critical project memory files (`gemini.md`, `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`).
2. **MOVE** any new troubleshooting artifacts you generate to `Troubleshooting_Agent/`.
3. Read `Troubleshooting_Agent/` for past context on fixes and issues.

This directory is designated for:
- `.md` status reports (e.g., `FIX_SUMMARY.md`)
- Debugging logs
- Implementation plans for specific hotfixes
- Verification checklists
